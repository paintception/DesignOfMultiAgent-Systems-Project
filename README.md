# Overview

The script does not do much yet. It generates a grid of roads (or cities), marks a number of them as inaccessible and marks a number of edge nodes as entry/exit points.

The script requires numpy and matplotlib. If those are installed (they probably are), run the script with:

    ./src/grid.py

or

    python src/grid.py

It should show a plot representing the grid.
